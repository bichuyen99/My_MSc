1.1.3 You was supposed to utilize the fact that matrix is low rank (r << m,n), thus you could produce a solution which is linear in (m,n), but if you form matrix B explicetely, then you can just calculate its norm by the definition without cubic complexity, so your algorithm doesn't really make much sense \
1.2.1 OK \
1.2.2 OK 
* Problem 2[2/15] pts 
1. Taylor series is mentioned, but the tail is not bounded. The rank of Taylor series is computed. 
2. No legit solution is presented. It is not clear what is the difference between the cases D=N and D=1. 
3. Presented no solution 
Problem 3[15/16] pts. What about algorithm's behaviour to reflections?
