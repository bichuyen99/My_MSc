# RAMOBoost: Ranked Minority Oversampling in Boosting

Based on the article by [S. Chen, H. He, and E. A. Garcia. "RAMOBoost: Ranked Minority Oversampling in Boosting". IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 2010.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5559472). 

A RAMO technique based on the idea of adaptive synthetic data generation in an ensemble learning system. Briefly, RAMOBoost adaptively ranks minority class instances at each learning iteration according to a sampling probability distribution that is based on the underlying data distribution, and can adaptively shift the decision boundary toward difficult-to-learn minority and majority class instances by using a hypothesis assessment procedure.
